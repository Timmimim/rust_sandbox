# Rust Sandbox
### ... and really not much more.

These are my first attempts at, and fiddlings with the **Rust** programming language. Well, aside from the GuessingGame, which was created as the initial exercise featured in **_The Book_**.

So far, there is a directory covering a large chunk of **basics** (hence the name), and a Hangman game written from scratch (in progress).

The basics follow a good video tutorial by **[Brad with TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw)**.

Stay tuned (or not) for some more stumbling, and hopefully soon some more competend coding in Rust.

Have a lovely day!
