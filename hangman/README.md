# Hangman (WIP!)

This directory is home to my very own game of Hangman, written from scratch as my first minor *Rust* project. 

The game is currently unfinished. However, the code uploaded to this repository will compile, and it will every step of the way.

Next steps will include an overhaul of my alphabet representation, which is quite clunky and was only a first draft, as well as actual game logic being introduced.
